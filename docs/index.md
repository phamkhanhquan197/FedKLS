# FedEasy: Federated Learning With Ease

<!-- ![FedEasy Logo](placeholder-for-logo.png) -->


FedEasy is an intuitive powerful yet simple to use Federated Learning framework built on top of [Flower](https://flower.ai/) framework and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Our goal is to streamline the process of setting up and running federated learning experiments, making advanced machine learning techniques accessible to researchers and developers alike.

## Key Features
- **Flower and PyTorch Integration:** Leverage the strengths of both the [Flower](https://flower.ai/) framework and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to create a robust federated learning environment.

- **Configurability:** Customize your federated learning setup using only a yaml file, which allows you to control data distributions, models, optimizers, training strategies, and more.

- **Extensive Documentation:** Discover detailed explanations of the supported datasets, models, and strategies in the documentation, making it easier to choose the right components for your project.

- **Easy Setup:** Follow a straightforward setup process using Git, Python, pip, and Miniconda to get your federated learning environment up and running.

- **Flexible Deployment:** Run federated learning simulations on a single machine and scale to multiple clients with ease or run in multi node manner to handle high computational needs.

- **Performance Metrics:** Save and analyze training results, including accuracy, loss, and time for each round, to track the progress of your federated learning model.

- **Contribution:** Contribute to the repository by enhancing existing features, adding new models or strategies, or improving documentation. Your contributions are welcome and will help make federated learning more accessible to everyone.

> **Note**: While FedEasy is primarily designed for Linux environments, Windows users can also use it with some adjustments.
