## Contributing Guidelines for FedEasy

### Introduction

FedEasy is an open-source federated learning framework that aims to make advanced machine learning techniques more accessible to a wider audience. We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and expand the framework. This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to FedEasy.

### Getting Started

1. **Familiarize yourself with the codebase**: Before contributing, take some time to review the FedEasy codebase and understand the overall architecture and design.
2. **Choose an issue to work on**: Browse the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nclabteam/FedEasy/issues) to find an issue that interests you and aligns with your skills or you can create a new issue and start working on that.

### Creating a New Branch

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
2. **Create a new branch from the `main` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-my-feature upstream/main
   ```

### Making Your Changes

1. **Implement your changes**: Ensure you follow the code style guidelines, add tests, and update documentation as needed.
2. **Stage your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
3. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add my awesome feature"
   ```

### Pushing Your Branch

   ```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Visit the FedEasy repository on GitHub**: Go to the FedEasy repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a new pull request**: Click the "New pull request" button. Select your forked repository and branch.
3. **Provide a clear description**: In the pull request description, clearly explain the problem you are addressing, the changes you've made, and how those changes address the problem. Include any relevant screenshots or code snippets.

### Review Process

1. **Code review**: The FedEasy maintainers will review your contribution to ensure it meets the contribution guidelines and is consistent with the codebase.
2. **Feedback and revisions**: You may receive feedback and requests for revisions during the review process. You can make additional commits to your branch and push them to your forked repository; they will automatically be added to the pull request.
